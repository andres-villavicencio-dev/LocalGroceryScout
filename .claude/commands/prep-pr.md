# Prep a clean commit and push a PR

Please help me prepare a clean commit and create a pull request:

1. **Review the current state**: Check git status and show me a summary of all changes
2. **Review the changes**: Show me the git diff to understand what has been modified
3. **Stage the files**: Add all relevant files to staging (or ask me which files to stage if there are unrelated changes)
4. **Create a commit**: Draft a clear, descriptive commit message following this repository's commit conventions
5. **Push the changes**: Push the commit to the remote repository
6. **Create a PR**: Use `gh pr create` to open a pull request with a well-structured title and description

Make sure to:
- Follow the existing commit message style in this repository
- Include a comprehensive PR description with a summary of changes and test plan
- Ask for confirmation before pushing or creating the PR if anything seems unclear
